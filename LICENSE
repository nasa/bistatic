It should be noted that the use of this program comes with it no guarantee of its performance or validity, nor does it carry any implication of customer support on the part of NASA. It is not suggested that the program be used for military tactical purposes, or any utilization where human cost is a factor dependent on the program’s performance. NASA does not assume responsibility for any loss of property, financial liabilities, etc. by use of this program. The program has been verified by internal process as well as an independent implementation of the ITU-R source material and it is reasonably anticipated to produce results matching those prescribed by source description. Since the code calls MATLAB standard functions there is program behavior overlap with COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) considerations. Updates and modifications to the code are intended when an ITU-R Recommendation is established as well as for subsequent revisions in the future. If there are any issues, potential bugs, questions, or concerns please feel free to contact the POCs of this distribution directly.
